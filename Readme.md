# Vogel5000 - Vim Colour Scheme

This is a Vim Color Scheme based on my [Vogel5000](https://github.com/jeffhiltz/vogel5000) palette.

I need to add some screenshots, but you can get an idea of the colors by looking at the Vogel5000 palette.

This repo is a fork of lifepillar's [vim-gruvbox8](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-gruvbox8) which is an implementation of [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) using [vim-colortemplate](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate).
